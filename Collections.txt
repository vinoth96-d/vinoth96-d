ArrayList>---
1.It is a dynamic data structue.
2.We can use add method to add the value / Get method to retrieve the value.
3.ArrayList follows the insertion order like [0],[1],[2],..
4.ArrayList accept duplicate values.
5.ArrayList is asynchronous.
6.It follows resizeable architecture.i.e When we remove index[2] value,index[3] value will come to the former index and so on.

LinkedList>---
1.It is a dynamic data structue where we could be able store many values without specifying dimensions.
2.We can use add method to add the value / Get method to retrieve the value.
3.It follows the insertion order like [0],[1],[2],..
4.It accept duplicate values.
5.ArrayList is asynchronous.
6.LinkedList follows doubly linked architecture. 

Common b/w Arraylist and Linkedlist:
1.we can to store multiple data either in Arraylist or Linkedlist.
2.Both are childs of LIST.
3.Both follows insertion order.
4.Both accepts duplicate values.
5.Both are asynchronised.

Diff b/w Arraylist and linkedlist:
1.arraylist follows resizeable architecture but linledlist follows doubly linked architecture.

When to use Arraylist & Linkedlist:
 when your frequent operation is to RETRIEVE the data then Arraylist is the best.
 when your frequent operation is to MODIFY the data theN Listedlist is the best.
